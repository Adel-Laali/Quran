- [The absolute power of Allah over the creation of man and the management of their affairs](https://quran.com/67/23-25)
- [The creation of the first man by the power of Allah](https://quran.com/17/51)
- [Ownership and lordship and the absolute power of Allah over all beings](https://quran.com/23/81-90)
