### My conclusion

We can't know what is good or what is bad. Almost all of the conflicts of human-kind throughout history can be traced back to differences in this matter.

All it takes is to gather a list of opposite doctrines and beliefs. That's all. And we immediately realize that many people had different definitions for good and bad.

The very existens of a long list of **ism**s proves that we don't know what is good, and what is bad.
